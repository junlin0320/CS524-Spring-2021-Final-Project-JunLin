    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The topic that our team settled on is undergrad course planning at UW-Madison. Selecting the appropriate courses for every semester can be a challenging process for some students who aren't certain about the degree structure and numerous requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that students picked their courses for every semester without considering future courses that have strict prerequisites, some of which are compulsory courses, it is very likely that the student will pick a non-optimum route for graduation. For example, a student will not be able to enroll in a compulsory course in a later semester if he/she hasn't taken the prerequisites to that course. As a result, he/she will have to enroll in the prerequisite courses before being able to enroll in the compulsory courses in subsequent semesters, which will delay the student's graduation date. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to find an optimal course selection for each semester in regards to completing the graduation requirements within the shortest period and the least number of courses taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.A Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the following constraints for course planning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prerequisites**: Some courses are required to be completed before enrolling in certain classes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Graduation requirements**: Some courses are required to be taken to meet the graduation requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Credit Limit**: The number of courses taken in any given semester cannot exceed a certain number of credit hours\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No retaking**: A course cannot be taken twice\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have the following constraints that can be added interactively: \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Desired courses**: Through the interactive console, the student can specify which courses must be included in the plan. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Limit workload**: We also allow the student to cap the maximum credit. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Transferred courses**: We allow user to specify the transferred courses before entering the university, so our planning program can take that into account. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.B Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- The graduation requirements are gathered from the [Online Underguade Guide](https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/#majorscertificatestext). \n",

    "### 2.A Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "We made the following assumptions for our course planning problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We assume that there is no time conflict for class attendance in a given semester. One can think that all the courses can be taken asynchronously in this pandemic time. This assumption is made since we haven't figured out a way to gather section-level data, and it complicates the optimization problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We assume that the student can pass all the courses taken so there is no retaking. \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- 1. For graduation requirements, we only consider the major requirements. Students can limit the maximum credit per semester to make space for the courses satisfying general education requirements.  -->"
